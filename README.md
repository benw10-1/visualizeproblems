# Visualize Traversion
This web application visualizes tree data structures, and the algorithms used for searching and traversing them. I use my own custom rendering engine to render the connections, animations, and nodes onto a canvas element. I also coded all of the node generation and traversion algorithms. I plan to implement a visualization for many Leetcode-like problems as well as the code for the solution to said problems.
